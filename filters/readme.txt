This folder contains filter scripts. They are intended to be used via the
Filter command that the filter.vim script provides.

The filters are organized by filetype. Filters in the 'all' folder are always
accessible.

If you add new filter scripts, they should read from STDIN, modify the text as
necessary, and write the result to STDOUT.
