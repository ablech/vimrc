                                                             *markdown-header*

# Header 1 #
## Header 2 ##
### Header 3 ###             (Hashes on right are optional)
#### Header 4 ####
##### Header 5 #####

## Markdown plus h2 with a custom ID ##         {#id-goes-here}
[Link back to H2](#id-goes-here)

                                                          *markdown-paragraph*

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace. 
Paragraphs can be on one 
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.  

                                                              *markdown-links*

This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.
[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.
This is [an example][id] reference-style link.

This is an implicit link to [Google][]

[id]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
[Google]: http://google.com/

                                                             *markdown-inline*

Now some inline markup like *italics*,  **bold**, and `code()`.
Underscores in words are ignored in Markdown Extra.

                                                           *markdown-pictures*

![picture alt](/images/photo.jpeg "Title is optional")     

Reference-style image syntax looks like this:
![Alt text][id]
Where “id” is the name of a defined image reference. 

[id]: url/to/image  "Optional title attribute"


                                                        *markdown-blockquotes*

> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

                                                              *markdown-lists*

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

1. A numbered list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

## Markdown plus definition lists ##

Bottled water
: $ 1.25
: $ 1.55 (Large)

Milk
Pop
: $ 1.75

* Multiple definitions and terms are possible
* Definitions can include multiple paragraphs too

                                                               *markdown-code*
And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

~~~

// Markdown extra adds un-indented code blocks too

if (this_is_more_code == true && !indented) {
    // tild wrapped code blocks, also not indented
}

~~~

                                                         *markdown-linebreaks*

Text with  
two trailing spaces  
(on the right)  
can be used  
for things like poems  

                                                              *markdown-rules*

### Horizontal rules

                                                               *markdown-html*

<div class="custom-class" markdown="1">
This is a div wrapping some Markdown plus.  Without the DIV attribute, it
ignores the 
block. 
</div>

                                                             *markdown-tables*

## Markdown plus tables ##

| Header | Header | Right  |
| ------ | ------ | -----: |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $10  |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $20  |

* Outer pipes on tables are optional
* Colon used for alignment (right versus left)


                                                               *markdown-abbr*

*[ABBR]: Markdown plus abbreviations (produces an <abbr> tag)


                                                          *markdown-footnotes*
* footnotes [^foot]
[^foot]: I really was missing those.
